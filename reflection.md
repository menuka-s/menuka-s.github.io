###### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Understanding all three are important to get positioning correctly. Blankspace can be either created or taken away depending on what you want. I used padding as a way to create left and right spacing in my navigation bar. There seemed to be some preset margins and paddings that I would have to edit so my site would display properly.

###### What did you learn about CSS positioning?
There is a lot of trial and error involved and a lot of terminology that I have to remember. Using DevTools helped a lot with figuring out where things should be positioned. There may be multiple ways to position things, but some of those ways may be more efficient or optimal than others.

###### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Coloring and positioning seemed the easiest. Having my content, headers, and footers stay correctly when I resize the screen was the hardest. I still haven't figured out how to counteract resizing my web page so content will not overlap other sections.

###### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Absolute positining for the header and footer with specific top and bottom values make the header and footer stay on the screen always. In the future I will want to figure out a new way so I can scroll through my content effectively.
