    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a recent graduate from Wisconsin interested in becoming a software developer. I originally graduate with a double-major in Microbiology and Political Science. After working for a little bit, I wasn't too happy about my career outlook so I went back to school and got a certificate in Computer Science. Now I'm enrolled at Dev Bootcamp to get more experience at coding.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing video games and watching my beloved Packers and Badgers (so many heartbreaks for both of them lately...). I also obsess over Game of Thrones, the books for them (which are way better by the way) and Star Wars.</p>
