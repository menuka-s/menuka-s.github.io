        I decided to look at how to pick random numbers in JavaScript vs Ruby this week. Both have very different ways of randomly picking numbers that are accessible to programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at Ruby first. In Ruby, picking a random number is fairly simple. All we need to do is basically <code>rand(max_value)</code>. This will randomly return a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and that number (exclusive). For example if we wanted any number between 1 and 10 we could use <code>rand(10) + 1</code>. Calling just <code>rand</code> without any arguments will return some random float. If we wanted a number in a specific range we can do that too: <code>rand(1..10)</code>. Another option in ruby is using <code>Random.new</code>, but it is bad practice to initialize a new random number generator each time we want a new random number.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is different though. Instead of getting a nice integer like in Ruby we don't get that in JS. Here we will use <code>Math.random();</code>. This returns some number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). So we could get some random decimal value such as 0.3423423421341234. So how would we get nice simple interger values? Well we we have to do a couple different things. First, we need to multiply that random decimal value by the max value we want. This basically gives a random number that fits our range. Second, we can use <code>Math.floor();</code> to get whole numbers. So lets look at an example, how about a random number between 1-10? <code>Math.floor(Math.random()*10) + 1</code>. In my opinion it isn't as simple as Ruby's implementation.
