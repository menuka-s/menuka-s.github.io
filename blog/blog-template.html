- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I liked being able to work with a pair for this since we were able to bounce ideas off each other. In this specific challenge we had similar thoughts, but we each had ideas that together helped our designing come out better.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Oh yes. I'm a huge proponent of wireframing and other types of mockups. Having a design out in front of you makes development a lot easier to do. This was extrememly helpful while pairing since sometimes it is hard to relay just your thoughts to another person.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Since we haven't had the opportunity to learn CSS yet, we thought it would be good to have a simple left-aligned page. Someone who comes to the page can easily see the title and sub-title. We thought it would be good to include a link to the blog index and links to the previous blog post and subsequent blog post.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Most of the code we used was learned through the past couple exercises, so I didn't necessarily learn anything new. We did discover that two seperate links will show up on the same line without using <p> tags. If I wanted to put another link on the next line, like I did with my wireframe, I have to use a separate <p> tag.
