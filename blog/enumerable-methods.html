      <h3>Week 5</h3>
      <h4>Enumerable-methods<br>12/20/15</h4>
      <p>
        This week I'm going to be talking about one of the enumerable methods: sort
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the common things that programming students will see when learning algorithms is all of the different sorting algorithms that exist. Ruby has a pretty simple sorting algorithm. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby's built in sort method returns an array. Sort can be called data structures such as hashes, arrays, etc. We can call .sort like:
      </p>
      <code>
        [2,6,4,1].sort
      </code>
      <p>
        which will return a sorted array of [1,2,4,6]. We can also sort by a block if we need to such as sorting a hash by values instead of keys like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        my_hash.sort{|key,value| value}
      </code>
      <p>
        When you call sort without specifying how you want to sort it, .sort is basically the equivalent of: 
      </p>
      <code>
        .sort{|x,y| x <=> y}
       </code>
       <p>
        This means that .sort is doing pairwise comparisons and comparing each value directly against its neighbor and returning a result based on that comparison with <=>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also by now, you've probably seen that there is a .sort_by method too. When sorting small things, either is fine. But when looking at larger sets of data, I would recommend using the .sort_by method instead. That methods uses a Scwartzian Transform algorithm for sorting which is a lower complexity method than what .sort uses (I believe .sort is just using pairwise comparisons which is has a complexity of N).
